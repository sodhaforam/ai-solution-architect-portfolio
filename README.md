My journey from Technical PM to AI Solution Architect - 12 week portfolio

🚀 AI Solution Architect Portfolio

 **Transforming from Technical PM to AI Solution Architect**  
 *12-week intensive learning journey | Feb - May 2026*

> ## 👋 About Me

I'm Foram Sodha, a Technical Project Manager with 10+ years of experience in BFSI, specializing in Indian stock broking. I'm transitioning to AI Solution Architect roles by combining my delivery leadership experience with hands-on AI/ML expertise.

### 🎯 Why This Transition?

After managing technology projects in stock broking for 7 years, I've seen AI transform from buzzword to business imperative. I want to move from managing AI projects to architecting them - designing systems that create real business value while understanding compliance, stakeholders, and delivery constraints that most engineers miss.

### 💪 My Unique Value Proposition

**I'm not just learning AI - I'm combining three critical skills:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Domain Expertise        Delivery Leadership    │
│  (10+ years BFSI)    +    (PM Experience)    +   │
│                                                  │
│           AI/ML Technical Skills                 │
│        (Building hands-on portfolio)             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        = AI Solution Architect
```

**What I Bring:**
- ✅ Understand business ROI, not just technical metrics
- ✅ Can explain AI to C-suite and engineers alike
- ✅ Stakeholder management across business and tech teams
